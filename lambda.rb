# In Ruby, a lambda, often referred to as a lambda function or simply a lambda, is a type of anonymous function. It is a way to define a small, inline function without giving it a name. Lambdas are instances of the Proc class and are often used for creating blocks of code that can be passed around as objects.

# Here's a detailed explanation of lambdas in Ruby:

# Syntax: Lambdas are created using the lambda keyword or the -> (stabby lambda) operator, followed by a block of code. The general syntax is:

lambda { |parameters| code }
# or
-> (parameters) { code }

# Parameters: You can specify parameters within the lambda's block, just like you would in a regular method. These parameters are enclosed in pipes (|) in the lambda's parameter list.

# Return Value: Lambdas, unlike regular methods, return a value when called. The return value is the result of the last expression evaluated within the lambda.

# Scope: Lambdas have lexical scoping, meaning they capture and remember the context in which they were created, including local variables and their values.

# Now, let's discuss some advantages of using lambdas in Ruby:

# Closures: Lambdas are closures, which means they can access and modify variables from their surrounding scope. This is especially useful for creating functions that "remember" data from their parent scope.

# Anonymous Functions: Lambdas allow you to define small, one-off functions without the need to give them a name. This is handy when you only need to use a function in a specific context.

# Passing Functions as Arguments: Lambdas can be passed as arguments to other functions, allowing you to create higher-order functions. This is a fundamental concept in functional programming and enables you to write more flexible and reusable code.

# Functional Programming: Lambdas are a crucial part of functional programming in Ruby. They can be used to implement features like map, filter, and reduce, which are common in functional programming paradigms.

# Code Blocks: Lambdas are often used to create code blocks that can be passed to methods like each, map, and filter. This allows for concise and readable code.

# Here's an example of using a lambda in Ruby:

# Define a lambda that squares a number
square = ->(x) { x * x }

# Use the lambda
result = square.call(5)
puts result # Output: 25
